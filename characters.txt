Jay Gatsby - a young, mysterious millionaire with shady business connections. Originally from North Dakota. During World War 1, when he was a young military officer stationed at the United States Army's Camp Taylor in Louisville, Kentucky, he encountered the love of his life, the beautiful debutante Daisy Buchanan. He has one goal in life: to reunited with his true love Daisy Buchanan. He is fixated on repeating the past and winning back her love.

Nick Carraway: Nick Carraway, a young man from a well-to-do family in the Midwest, is both the narrator and a key character in the story. After serving in World War I, Nick moves to New York in the summer of 1922 to learn the bond business, hoping to find success in the East. Honest, tolerant, and inclined to reserve judgment, Nick becomes the perfect confidant for those around him. He rents a modest house in West Egg, next to Jay Gatsby’s mansion, and quickly finds himself drawn into the complex world of wealth, romance, and intrigue that surrounds his cousin, Daisy Buchanan, and her wealthy husband, Tom. Nick’s experiences and observations shape the narrative, making him both a participant and a chronicler of the events that unfold.

Daisy Buchanan: Daisy Buchanan, a beautiful and charming debutante from Louisville, Kentucky, is the object of Jay Gatsby’s obsessive love. Now married to Tom Buchanan, Daisy lives in East Egg, where she is surrounded by luxury and the privileges of old money. Despite her enchanting exterior, Daisy is deeply conflicted, torn between her love for Gatsby and her loyalty to Tom. Her voice, described as “full of money,” symbolizes both her allure and her detachment from the struggles of those around her. Trapped in a world of superficiality and disillusionment, Daisy’s choices ultimately reveal her inner frailty and her inability to fully commit to anyone but herself.

Thomas “Tom” Buchanan: Thomas “Tom” Buchanan, Daisy’s wealthy and domineering husband, is a man of immense privilege and power. Hailing from an old, established family, Tom embodies the arrogance and entitlement of the American upper class. A former college football star, he exudes physical strength and an aggressive personality, often using his influence to intimidate others. Tom’s blatant racism, infidelity, and disregard for those outside his social circle reveal his deeply ingrained sense of superiority. Despite his flaws, Tom remains deeply possessive of Daisy, unwilling to let go of her even as he engages in a passionate affair with Myrtle Wilson. His actions throughout the story highlight the moral decay that lies beneath the glittering surface of his life
